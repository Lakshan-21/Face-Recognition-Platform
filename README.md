### Architecture Components

**Frontend Layer:**
- React-based user interface with TypeScript for type safety
- Real-time webcam integration and live face detection display
- Responsive design with Twitter blue theming
- WebSocket client for real-time updates

**Backend API Layer:**
- Express.js server with RESTful API endpoints
- Authentication and session management
- WebSocket server for live communication
- Database abstraction layer with type-safe operations

**AI/ML Processing Layer:**
- Python-based face recognition service using industry-standard libraries
- OpenCV for image processing and computer vision tasks
- Face detection, encoding, and comparison algorithms
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine for intelligent chat responses

**Data Persistence Layer:**
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
- Structured data storage for users, face registrations, and events
- Analytics and logging data with efficient indexing
- Automatic data retention and cleanup policies

### Data Flow

1. **Face Registration:** Camera captures image â†’ Frontend processes â†’ API validates â†’ Python service encodes â†’ Database stores
2. **Live Recognition:** Camera stream â†’ Real-time detection â†’ Face comparison â†’ WebSocket broadcast â†’ UI updates
3. **Chat Interface:** User query â†’ RAG engine processes â†’ Context retrieval â†’ Response generation â†’ Display

This architecture ensures high performance, scalability, and maintainability while providing accurate face recognition capabilities and intelligent user interactions.

## Domain Integration with Cloudflare (.cc)

### Custom Domain Setup

To deploy your Katomaran Face Recognition Platform with a custom .cc domain through Cloudflare:

#### Prerequisites
- Active Cloudflare account
- Custom .cc domain registered
- Deployment platform with custom domain support

#### Setup Steps

1. **Configure DNS in Cloudflare:**
   - Add a CNAME record pointing your domain to your deployment URL
   - Set the record to "Proxied" (orange cloud) for Cloudflare's CDN benefits
   - Example: `your-domain.cc` â†’ `your-app-name.deployment-platform.app`

2. **Update Deployment Settings:**
   - Navigate to your project's deployment configuration
   - Add your custom domain in the "Custom Domains" section
   - Verify domain ownership through the provided verification process

3. **Environment Configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Add to your .env file
   CUSTOM_DOMAIN=your-domain.cc
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=your-domain.cc,localhost:5000

   
## Configuration

### Face Recognition Settings
- **Confidence Threshold**: Adjustable via slider in the Recognition tab
- **Detection Sensitivity**: Configurable in the live recognition interface
- **Bounding Box Display**: Toggle face detection visualizations

### Database Schema
The application uses the following main tables:
- `face_registrations` - Stores registered face data
- `recognition_events` - Logs face recognition events
- `chat_messages` - Stores chat interactions
- `system_logs` - Application logging

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Camera not working:**
- Ensure camera permissions are granted
- Check if another application is using the camera
- Try refreshing the page

**Face detection not working:**
- Verify the Python service is running
- Check camera lighting conditions
- Ensure face is clearly visible in the frame

**Database connection issues:**
- Verify PostgreSQL is running
- Check DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Run database migrations: `npm run db:push`

**Python service errors:**
- Install required Python packages
- Check Python version compatibility
- Verify camera access permissions
